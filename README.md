# Docker Compose Templates

Docker Compose file templates for various useful containerized services.

Volumes are stored relative to the current folder (makes it easier to move and backup volumes). The convention used is `./volumes/CONTAINER_NAME/VOLUME_NAME`.

A much more comprehensive list of templates can be found at <https://github.com/Haxxnet/Compose-Examples>.
