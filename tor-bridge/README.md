# About

This compose file sets up a local Tor bridge relay on your system using the `ilshidur/tor-relay` container. Bridge relays are recommended for home users with low bandwidth connections. They are unlisted; your bridge will not show up in the public [Tor Relay Search](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html).
